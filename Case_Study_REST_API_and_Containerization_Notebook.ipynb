    "In the competitive landscape of retail banking, customer retention is critical for ensuring sustainable growth and profitability. A prominent retail banking institution in Europe provides a range of financial products, including credit cards, loans, and savings accounts, and has been rapidly expanding its customer base across multiple countries. However, with a growing customer base, it faces an increasingly pressing challenge: customer churn. A significant number of customers are closing their accounts and switching to competitors. This decline in customer retention is impacting revenue and long-term customer relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the reasons behind customer attrition (or churn) is essential for the bank to devise effective retention strategies to minimize churn and enhance customer loyalty and satisfaction. The Customer Analytics & Retention Department has been diligently collecting and analyzing historical customer data. Despite the valuable insights provided by historical data, the department grapples with several challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Complex Customer Behavior**: The diverse nature of the bank's offerings and the varying customer preferences across different countries complicate the identification of factors that lead to churn.\n",
    "2. **Proactive Retention**: The current processes for identifying at-risk customers are reactive rather than proactive, leading to missed opportunities for timely interventions that could prevent churn."

    "The Customer Analytics & Retention Department deployed a churn prediction model as a simple web application to enable real-time, data-driven decision-making through an intuitive interface. However, as access was scaled to geographically distributed teams, the centralized deployment model led to performance bottlenecks and increased latency. Attempts to share the deployment model resulted in frequent failures due to inconsistencies in system environments, operating systems, and dependencies.\n",

    "To address these challenges, the department aims to find a better mechanism to package the model, environment, dependencies, and configuration into a standardized unit that runs reliably across different systems. The objective is to eliminate compatibility issues, reduce deployment errors, simplify distribution, and allow each location to use the app with minimal setup. Ultimately, it ensures scalable, consistent, and resilient access to the churn prediction system, empowering all teams to take timely, proactive retention actions."

    "    - ***This backend handles the prediction logic*** and returns JSON responses.\n",
    "    - We’ll deploy this Flask app along with the model file and `requirements.txt` into a Hugging Face space using a `Dockerfile`, making it publicly accessible through a URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Next, we’ll build a separate Streamlit app (`app.py`) that acts as the user interface. This app will include form inputs for online prediction and a CSV uploader for batch prediction.\n",
    "    - In both cases, it will ***send data to the Flask API*** using the `requests` library and display the responses in a clean, readable format.\n",
    "    - We’ll deploy this Streamlit app with its own `requirements.txt` to another Hugging Face space.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Once both spaces are live, we’ll be able to access the model and make predictions for single as well as multiple users."
